            <p>I have been wanting to create my own company for a very long time, even before I graduated.</p>
<p>While it would have sucked an awful lot if I did it at that time for multiple reasons — lack of skills and experience mainly — it became more achievable recently.</p>
<p>In 2013, I tried my hand at a product company to solve the recruitment process called Hizard where we failed before even getting a single customer because of a lack of time and a lack of motivation: hiring sector was a safe bet, not something we were particularly interested in.</p>
<p>The code for Hizard is available on <a href="https://github.com/hizardapp/Hizard">github</a>, a very simple django app.</p>
<p>I then worked as a contractor, which is nice for the 100% pay raise compared to a full-time employee.</p>
<p>The only issue with contracting is being an 'ammo' can be loaded onto an existing project/team to add features but more likely to fix bugs rather than having a project from the beginning, which I enjoy much more.</p>
<p>With two other friends (including the one I did Hizard with), we thought it would be better to start our own company to work on interesting projects and have more freedom to work on open-source things (one of the guy worked at Google, which is pretty strict regarding that).</p>
<p>That's how we decided to create an agency/tech consultancy focusing on backends and <em>interesting</em> problems (think machine learning for example) rather than your run-of-the-mill digital agency doing CMS work.</p>
<p>The company was incorporated last week and its name is <strong>We Are Wizards</strong>, which was actually the name of my limited company as a contractor.</p>
<p>The website is at https://wearewizards.io (link now dead) and the twitter handle is @WeAreWizardsIO.</p>
<p>You can contact us through twitter or send an email to <strong>vincent@wearewizards.io</strong> if you want to talk about some projects you have.</p>
<p>You can also expect more articles coming on our blog once it's live, we just need to write the first one !</p>
