            <p><a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg">Gutenberg</a> is a powerful static site engine inspired by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> but simpler to use.
You can build pretty much any kind of static site with it using markdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>a basic blog</li>
<li>a landing site</li>
<li>a knowledge base</li>
<li>a gitbook</li>
<li>a documentation site</li>
<li>all of the above combined</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download built binaries from the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/releases">Github releases page</a>. If you were using Gutenberg
through Cargo, I will not upload new versions to crates.io for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2263">package for binary crates don't use the Cargo.lock</a> which means a dependency having breaking changes
without respecting SemVer will cause the crate to compile but <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/92">fail at runtime</a> in some cases</li>
<li>I moved to using a Cargo workspace with many small crates to improve iteration speed</li>
<li>with Sass, building Gutenberg has become more involved and it is easier to let user install the already built binary</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.vincentprouillet.com/blog/announcing-gutenberg/">my article introducing Gutenberg</a>,
my main issue with Hugo is the extremely poor â€” and I'm being kind here â€” template engine it is using.
This was solved in the first release of Gutenberg by using a template engine similar to Jinja2 I wrote: <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">Tera</a>.</p>
<p>Another annoying thing was that, since I was using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> to write CSS, each static site had to set up
Sass compilation, usually with node/yarn/gulp.</p>
<p>With Gutenberg 0.1.0, this is solved as it ships with a static version of libsass, the C++ Sass compiler and allows
commits like <a href="https://gitlab.com/Keats/vincent.is/commit/2a05cdad4cfd9dac103c9907488ad71518886440">this one</a>.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the current set of features - it's pretty packed for a 0.1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>live reload</strong>: when anything changes, Gutenberg will do the minimum work required and will live reload assets (js/css/images/...) if possible</li>
<li><strong>syntax highlighting</strong> built-in via <a href="https://github.com/trishume/syntect">syntect</a></li>
<li><strong>pagination</strong></li>
<li><strong>easy internal linking</strong>: they look like <code>[my article](@/blog/blabla.md)</code></li>
<li><strong>automatic table of contents</strong></li>
<li><strong>automatic insertion of anchors on titles</strong>: same as <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg">READMEs on Github</a></li>
<li><strong>shortcodes</strong>: when you want to insert some HTML in a page but don't want to copy the HTML everywhere. For example
<code>{{ youtube(id="dQw4w9WgXcQ") }}</code> is a built-in shortcode and will insert the YouTube video for that id.</li>
<li><strong>Sass compilation</strong></li>
<li><strong>RSS feed</strong> generation when requested</li>
<li><strong>Tags and categories</strong> generation when requested</li>
<li><strong>co-location of assets and content</strong>: when an article has some images and you want to keep them in the same folder</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-s-next" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-s-next">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>The current features are pretty much what I wanted to have when I started Gutenberg but that doesn't mean there isn't anything left to do!</p>
<h3 id="i18n">i18n<a class="zola-anchor" href="#i18n" aria-label="Anchor link for: i18n">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>The discussion started on <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/13">github</a> but as it isn't a feature I need, I would
rather have someone else doing it, once there is consensus on the implementation</p>
<h3 id="alternative-rendering-backends">Alternative rendering backends<a class="zola-anchor" href="#alternative-rendering-backends" aria-label="Anchor link for: alternative-rendering-backends">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Right now, only markdown is supported. While I definitely don't want to have too many backend, <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/">Asciidoc</a>
is one I was interested in and <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/32">antoyo</a> started working on a asciidoc implementation so
it should be coming eventually!</p>
<h3 id="theme-support">Theme support<a class="zola-anchor" href="#theme-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: theme-support">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/91">An issue</a> was opened on Gutenberg to support themes.
While the idea in the issue is IMO too complex, I would like to have some theme support baked in <code>gutenberg</code>,
unless the <code>git clone a-template-repo</code> approach is simpler.</p>
<h3 id="deploying">Deploying<a class="zola-anchor" href="#deploying" aria-label="Anchor link for: deploying">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>A subcommand to upload/push the generated site to Github Pages/server/service could be nice. Maybe this can be resolved
with documentation instead though.</p>
<h3 id="a-documentation-site">A documentation site<a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-documentation-site" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-documentation-site">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Now that things are a bit more stable in Gutenberg, I will start working on a documentation site as Gutenberg Readme is currently not
nearly enough. I've already started one for <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera/tree/master/docs">Tera</a> and am mostly waiting for design inspiration
before publishing it.</p>
<h3 id="packaging">Packaging<a class="zola-anchor" href="#packaging" aria-label="Anchor link for: packaging">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Lastly, I think it's time to put Gutenberg in <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/12">packages managers</a>. I will probably
put it on <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> if no one beats me to it but I will need help for the other package managers.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>As always I welcome any feedback. If you are using Gutenberg, please reply on <a href="https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/100">this issue</a> so I
can update the list in the README.</p>
<p>Joyeux 14 Juillet!</p>
