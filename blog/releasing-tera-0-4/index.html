            <p>I'm happy to announce <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">Tera</a> 0.4 has been released on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>Tera is a template engine based on <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">Jinja2</a> and the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/language/">Django template language</a>.
I say based as it's not a 1:1 port and has some minor differences with them but is close enough that you should be able
to use the same syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>This version introduces the last big features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tera.netlify.com/docs/#macros">Macros</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tera.netlify.com/docs/#inheritance">Multiple level extend, super() and nested blocks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tera.netlify.com/docs/#auto-escaping">Autoescape</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It also adds the <code>filesizeformat</code> filter thanks to the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/humansize">humansize crate</a>.</p>
<p>Some bits are experimental (named endblock/endmacro, kwargs only) and subject to changes depending on feedback.</p>
<p>There are probably features that others deem essential (please <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues">create an issue</a> if you can think of one missing!) but for my own use case it seems feature complete, apart from
the missing <code>not</code> operator in conditions. Custom tags would be nice too.</p>
<p>The focus for the next version will be on:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixing the inevitable bugs</li>
<li>add the <code>not</code> operator</li>
<li>improving documentation: a website and more examples</li>
<li>improving error handling and reporting (maybe <a href="https://github.com/brson/error-chain">error-chain</a> could help there?)</li>
<li>optimizations and code cleanup</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, no new big features planned, it will be mostly polishing.</p>
<p>To ensure Tera is easy to use, I'm thinking of making a static site engine using it but that will depend on how much free time I have.
I'm currently using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for all my sites but the Golang template engine is godawful.</p>
<p>Making the templates compile to Rust functions is still not planned in the near future.
Check out <a href="https://maud.lambda.xyz/">Maud</a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/horrorshow/0.6.1/horrorshow/">horrorshow</a> if you want type-safe HTML.</p>
<p>If you want to help you have 2 options: use it and report bugs and/or look at the issues tagged for the 0.5 milestone on <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues">github</a>.
The code is fairly clean, commented and has lots of tests so it should be easy to jump in.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez">SergioBenitez</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yonran">yonran</a> for the help!</p>
<h2 id="other-crates">Other crates<a class="zola-anchor" href="#other-crates" aria-label="Anchor link for: other-crates">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<h3 id="bcrypt-0-1-2">bcrypt (0.1.2)<a class="zola-anchor" href="#bcrypt-0-1-2" aria-label="Anchor link for: bcrypt-0-1-2">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>This one has an explicit name and is stable.
I was thinking of extracting the bcrypt specific code from <a href="https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto">rust-crypto</a>
but someone already started on that: <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">https://github.com/RustCrypto</a> so I'll just wait.</p>
<h3 id="dbmigrate-0-2-7">dbmigrate (0.2.7)<a class="zola-anchor" href="#dbmigrate-0-2-7" aria-label="Anchor link for: dbmigrate-0-2-7">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>A CLI tool to general and manage SQL migrations for MySQL, SQLite and Postgres.
It is stable and I don't foresee the API or the migration file format changing so I will probably promote it to 1.0 soon.</p>
<h3 id="jsonwebtoken-1-1-5">jsonwebtoken (1.1.5)<a class="zola-anchor" href="#jsonwebtoken-1-1-5" aria-label="Anchor link for: jsonwebtoken-1-1-5">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Strongly typed JWT library. I like the current API but a few more features are planned for 2.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving to Serde from rustc-serialize</li>
<li>implementing the missing algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues are created on the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/rust-jwt/issues">github repo</a> so feel free to take one of these before I get to them.</p>
<h3 id="vat-0-1-0">vat (0.1.0)<a class="zola-anchor" href="#vat-0-1-0" aria-label="Anchor link for: vat-0-1-0">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Validate EU VAT number and VAT rates for each country. Still not entirely sure why I made that crate but I think I'll try switching it
to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reqwest">reqwest</a> when I have time.</p>
<p>I also never got around handling errors from the VIES API since it was always working when I was looking at it and they don't (AFAIK) detail
their error messages anywhere.</p>
