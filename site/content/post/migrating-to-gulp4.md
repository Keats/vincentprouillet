Hello there.  
For those that haven't seen my previous blog post, all new content will be posted on my company's [blog](https://blog.wearewizards.io/).  

I posted an article this week about migrating my [ng-boilerplate](https://github.com/Keats/ng-boilerplate) from gulp 3 to gulp 4.  
  
You can read it [here](https://blog.wearewizards.io/migrating-to-gulp-4-by-example).
