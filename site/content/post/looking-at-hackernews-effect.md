Hello there.  
For those that haven't seen my previous blog post, all new content will be posted on my company's [blog](https://blog.wearewizards.io/).  

I posted an article last week about examining the HackerNews effect after my [protobuf/json article](https://blog.wearewizards.io/using-protobuf-instead-of-json-to-communicate-with-a-frontend) got into the first spot of HN.
