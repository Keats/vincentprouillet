Hello there.  
For those that haven't seen my previous blog post, all new content will be posted on my company's [blog](https://blog.wearewizards.io/).  

I posted an article today about the release of a project I've worked on, [gulp-sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass).  
  
You can read it [here](https://blog.wearewizards.io/gulp-sass-v2-released).
