Hello there.  
For those that haven't seen my previous blog post, all new content will be posted on my company's [blog](https://blog.wearewizards.io/).  

I posted an article this week about comparing weather in places I've lived using Pandas in a notebook.  
  
You can read it [here](https://blog.wearewizards.io/comparing-the-weather-of-places-ive-lived-in).
